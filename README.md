**Objective:-**
Developing a user-friendly voice-to-text and text-to-voice tool using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Introduction:-**
This project is based on the text to voice and voice to text system in which we use technologies like HTML, CSS, JS.

In this project there are two modules text to voice and voice to text module.

In voice to text module people speak any paragraph instead of typing that paragraph . It is helpful for the people those are not want to write anything so they speak after click listen button then their voice is convert into text by choosing language.
In text to voice module people convert their text into voice. This module is helpful for the people’s who don’t know the pronunciation of any paragraph/text so they type text in the form and then click on speak button then the text which is written in the form is convert into voice by choosing user choice language's.
